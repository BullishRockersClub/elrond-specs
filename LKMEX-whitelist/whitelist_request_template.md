#Template for requesting transferRole for LKMEX

Transferability
In order to conserve its energy and protect its benefits, old and new LKMEX will no longer be transferable, being
henceforth bound to the account where it was initially locked. Some limited transfers for LKMEX will still continue
to be allowed - check the whitepaper for this.

Other services and products beyond xExchange can request for transfer roel which will have to be authorized by the
governance. Before the xExchange (Maiar DEX 2.0)  launch, projects will be able to submit a request via Github to be
whitelisted.

Note that only projects and smart contracts that serve as catalysts for user adoption and that bring valuable use
cases will be considered eligible (for example use cases that go against the principles outlined above, where LKMEX
rules are overridden, re-enabling selling or buying will not be eligible). After the  xExchange (Maiar DEX 2.0) launch,
pre-whitelisted projects and SCs will potentially be revisited through a governance call.

The project has to make a pull-request in the current repository, where he adds a new file in the LKMEX-whitelist
folder by filling in the current template document. The name of the document should be the name of the project.

Note: the will lose the transfer role after you make an upgrade on the contract. The projects needs to make a new pull
request, where he updates the new code of the smart contract and explains the changes.
