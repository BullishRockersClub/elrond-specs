#Template for requesting transferRole for LKMEX

Transferability
To conserve its energy and protect its benefits, old and new LKMEX will no longer be transferable,  
subsequently bound to the account where it was initially locked. Some limited transfers for LKMEX will continue
to be allowed - check the whitepaper for this.

Other services and products beyond xExchange can request transfer roles which will have to be authorized by the
governance. Before the xExchange (Maiar DEX 2.0)  launch, projects can submit a request via Github to be
whitelisted.

We will consider eligible for `transferRole` only projects and smart contracts serving as catalysts for user adoption 
and those who are bringing valuable use cases (for example, use cases that go against the principles outlined above, 
where LKMEX rules are overridden, re-enabling selling or buying will not be eligible).
After the xExchange (Maiar DEX 2.0) launch, pre-whitelisted projects and SCs will potentially be revisited through a 
governance call.

The project has to make a pull request in the current repository, where it adds a new file in the LKMEX-whitelist
folder by filling in the existing template document. The name of the document should be the name of the project.

Note: Projects will lose the transfer role after upgrading the contract. You need to make a new pull request, where 
updates brought as new code to the smart contract must be explained and motivated.
